# Miami versus NYC

On September 1, 2021, I left NYC for Miami, for a variety of reasons.

I lived through the entire pandemic in NYC, including a complete lockdown, daily press conferences for months, palpable public apprehensiveness, and almost everything being closed for the entire winter of 2020-21.

I've come to believe most outsidde NYC don't quite realize how bad things were, on a social and psychological level beyond just the medical.

I lived in a studio.
