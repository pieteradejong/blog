* World record: 14 human beings in space simultaneously, between ISS and [space tourists](https://www.space.com/inspiration4-spacex.html) combined. The previous record had been 13.

* Major groundwork construction for the early-2022 expected launch of the [largest vehicle](https://www.google.com/search?q=spacex+starship&sxsrf=AOaemvKhfGyylOCHynw5wmlJNpQhuadypA:1640560212429&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiL68aFy4L1AhXdQjABHbiGA5MQ_AUoA3oECAIQBQ&biw=1512&bih=776&dpr=2) ever flown, including the Apollo Program.
