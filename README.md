# Blog

**I love to write**. Hence this blog. I've started by deploying it to GitHub, and when you read this it may be on my website.

Since I'm a software developer, deploying content on GitHub is straightforward. And since I wanted to start writing before having fully figured out my web presence, it made sense to start here.


**Why do I love to write?** Writing is many things:
* Writing is a creative act. It spurs your imagination, encourages further thought, confronts you with nebulous thoughts, and much more.

* Writing in public and online showcases your mind, ideas, and thoughts, to all of humanity. There is an essentially limitless universe of potential connections to make, collaborations, and discoveries.

* Writing in English, or any other human language, is analogous to writing computer code: it's about directly translating your thoughts and imagination onto the screen or physical paper. 

*  Writing is about language and linguistics. Which word is the best choice? Can I be more clear, cogent, and succinct? Am I being to convoluted or complicated?
