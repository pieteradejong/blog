# [DRAFT] Future Thinking

_How to think about the Future_

I’m very passionate about the future, have been since young.
beyond 5 years, almost everything unpredictable
closest to deterministic is Demographics
useful tools for future projecting:
trend extrapolation
catastrophe exploration (“known unknowns”, “unknown unknowns”)
demographic projections, generations out
scenario planning
historical understanding
“would this work for humans x thousand years ago”
