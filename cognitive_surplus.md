#[DRAFT] Clay Shirky’s Cognitive Surplus
What if there was an invisible phenomenon[?] that guides many of your daily decisions, and that you almost certainly contribute to on a very regular basis? 

What do Wikipedia, online reviews, online Q&A forums like Quora, crowd-sourced dictionaries, and many more, have in common?

They all capitalize, definitely socially and perhaps financially, on a phenomenon described by Clay Shirky in his 2010 TED talk [video 13mins]["How cognitive surplus will change the world"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu7ZpWecIS8).

As a technologist, I think a lot about all aspects of tech, including social, economic, financial, technical, etc. Cognitive Surplus (CS) jumps out as a phenomenon that is one of the primary benefits of the digital revolution, yet highly underappreciated and perhaps not even explicitly articulated since Shirky’s talk.

So what exactly is Cognitive Surplus? As Shirky describes it, it is enabled by two factors: human generosity and digital technology.

Human generosity is a trait that has been within (some of) us for the existence of our species. It might especially thrive when people of good will feel they can trust each other and be reciprocal.

Digital technology was truly kicked off with the invention of the integrated circuit, and the subsequent computer revolution that is still ongoing and brought us all the technology you are using to read this. Especially the Internet/Web, the smartphone, and social media have caused a quantum leap. (It would be interesting to get Shirkey’s updated assessment of the CS given developments since his talk.)

With the broad technological revolutions since the Industrial Revolution, human beings now have both the free time, and the digital technology to contribute their cognitive efforts toward an almost Global Cognitive Surplus.

Application to Software:
Software is eating the world
Economics of Open Source
create once, replicate ad infinitum

Pareto’s law:
creation side: a few contribute most (see Wikipedia)

Social media: sharing memes

Communal surplus: by the community, for the community
Civic value: created by participants, benefiting society as a whole

How much free time do Americans have? 
Rand Study says 5 hrs: https://www.cdc.gov/pcd/issues/2019/19_0017.htm
5 hours/day * 365 days * 300 million Americans = 547,500,000,000 free hours per year, roughly half a trillion or .
